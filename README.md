- 💡 I specialise in frontend development, mainly using Javascript, PHP, CSS, HTML, MySQL, Angular, WordPress, and Moodle.
- 🎓 I received my degree in Computer Science from the University of the Philippines Visayas ✊.
- 👨‍💻 I’m a certified [Backbase Frontend Engineer](https://francolouietm.github.io/assets/franco-bbfe-wa3-certificate.pdf).
